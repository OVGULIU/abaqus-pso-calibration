Optimal calibration of continuum cyclic constitutive model using Particle Swarm Optimization.

### Based on:
Smith, C.M., Kanvinde, A.M., Deierlein, G.G. (2013) *Optimal calibration of continuum cyclic constitutive model for structural steel using Particle Swarm Optimization*, Journal of Structural Engineering

### About:
Originally developed by Chris Smith (2013). His original code can be found here: 
http://purl.stanford.edu/qy227tf3022

His code did not have many comments, and was difficult for me to understand. I went through it, commented extensively, and provided some minor optimizations/refactoring; this code is the result of my efforts. (Vince Pericoli 2015)
